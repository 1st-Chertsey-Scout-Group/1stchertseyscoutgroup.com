Comedy Night – Saturday 12th March 2022 – 7pm – Scout HQ

No, this is not a joke!

After several COVID-related postponements, we are pleased to announce that the popular Comedy Night will return to 1st Chertsey Scout Group, courtesy of our brilliant supporters and comedy aficionados Stephen Diplacito and Dave Cooper.

As ever, we will have some excellent comedy acts, plus our ever-popular auction and raffle.

This time, we are very lucky to have the legendary Matt Price lined up (who has had us all in stitches before), alongside the hilarious Paul Cox, and some other very special comedy guest acts.

Tickets are limited and available now of booking online: [CLICK TO BOOK](https://www.ticketsource.co.uk/1st-chertsey-scout-group).

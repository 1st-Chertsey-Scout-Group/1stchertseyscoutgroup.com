On Sunday, 10th November, members of the 1st Chertsey Scout Group came together to honor Remembrance Day with a moving parade and wreath-laying ceremony at the War Memorial outside St. Peter’s Church. Young people from each section, proudly wore their full uniforms and gathered with leaders, families, and members of the community to pay their respects.

The parade began promptly at 10:15 a.m. from our Scout HQ, with a procession along Staines Lane leading up to the memorial.

Upon arriving at St. Peter’s, the group participated in a short reflection, as the church bells marked the 11th hour. In a moment of silence, everyone gathered stood together in remembrance of those who made the ultimate sacrifice. The scouts then placed poppy wreaths, handmade by each of our Cubs sections, at the memorial as a symbolic gesture of respect and gratitude.

One of our leaders, Emma, stood proudly alongside the flag bearers, representing the spirit and unity of the group.

After the ceremony, the group paraded back to HQ for refreshments, where everyone enjoyed time together, reflecting on the meaning of the day and the importance of remembering those who served.

Thank you to all who attended and supported this special event. We are proud of our young people for their respectful participation and the honor they showed for those we remember each November.

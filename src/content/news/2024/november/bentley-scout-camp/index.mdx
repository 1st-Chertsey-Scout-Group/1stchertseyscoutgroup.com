#### **Day 1: Firestarter Making and Abseiling**

We kicked off the first day by making homemade firestarters using a combination of candle wax, tumble dryer lint, and egg cartons. This simple yet effective method kept our fires going throughout the weekend! Later, we took to the ropes with an abseiling session. Everyone gave it their all braving the heights with a big smiles!

#### **Day 2: Cave Maze, Jacob’s Ladder, and Cooking on the Fire**

Day two brought even more adventure! In the morning, we challenged ourselves in the cave maze, where teamwork and courage were essential. Then it was off to tackle the Jacob’s Ladder, where in pairs they worked together to climb as high as they could on the suspended logs.  

For lunch, everyone got hands-on with toasted sandwiches over the fire embers – a camp favorite! As the evening rolled in, we prepared our “Cowboy Supper,” a mix of diced potatoes, carrots, onions, and beef, wrapped in foil and cooked directly in the fire.

#### **Day 3: Assault Course Challenge**

On our final day, we wrapped up the camp with the assault course. Mud, ropes, and plenty of laughs helped make it a great conclusion to an amazing weekend. They all showed impressive agility as they navigated the obstacles!
